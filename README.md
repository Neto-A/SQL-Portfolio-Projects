## Project 1: World COVID-19 Figures.
##### Brief Description: 
This is my first SQL portfolio project, completed in July 2022. It uses COVID-19 death and vaccination figures recorded between
23rd February, 2020 and 30th April, 2021.

##### Dataset: 
The datasets used were obtained from @AlextheAnalyst's Github page, which will be linked below:
- COVID Deaths: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/raw/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx
- COVID Vaccinations: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/raw/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx

##### Software used: 
The queries were written in Microsoft SQL Server, and should be run on the same.
