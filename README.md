# SQL-Portfolio-Projects
This is a repository containing all my SQL projects. 
I will be using either Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL for each project.

--PROJECT 1: WORLD COVID-19 FIGURES.
Brief Description: This is my first SQL portfolio project, completed in July 2022. It uses COVID-19 death and vaccination figures recorded between
23rd February, 2020 and 30th April, 2021.

Dataset: The datasets used were obtained from @AlextheAnalyst's Github page, which will be linked below:

COVID Vaccinations: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/raw/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx

Software used: The queries were written in Microsoft SQL Server, and should be run on the same.
